# pytest-pratice

#### install pytest library using 'pip install pytest'

#### the file for which you wants to write tests should have the same name as the file.

* for example i want to write test for the file named 'my_functions.py'
* then the the test file name should be 'test_my_function.py'

* similarly if the function name is 'add()'. 
* then the test name for that function should be 'test_add()'

**one of the advantage of this approach is that tests file are automatically detected**

* to run an individual test:  `pytest 'relative path of the file' `
